### Problem:
Customer-Credit-Card-transaction-predicition -- To Predict average credit card spend of customers in the next three months based on previous three months user data.

A dictionary data has been attached to understand the variables better.

### TODO : 
1. Tuning hyperparameters to find the optimal hyperparameters that gives the best prediction.
2. Try different Neural Networks.
3. Regressions models from sklearn, LGB
4. ARIMA
